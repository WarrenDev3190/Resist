<p>Here are common outcomes I'd like to achieve in whatever I pursue:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Notoriety / Fame</strong>
I want us as a band and as individuals to be recognized
for our talents as musicians, writers and producers.
I have an aspiration for our work to be awarded, Grammy's
Gold/Platinum Records etc.. It's something I think we have
inside of us to accomplish; and with that comes the reality that a band does have to travel and perform. I am not of the mind to throw away our daily lives haphazardly to pursue that end. I want to be intelligent in how we evaluate our steps towards this end. </p>

<p>With the internet and it's various platforms, it's very reasonable to build a following without the dredge of being road warriors and being away from jobs and families. I will concede and fully expect that we will have to travel and tour at some point but I'm willing to do so when the time comes. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Financially Sustainable/Profitable</strong>
I don't view our musical pursuits to be a hobby.
It's a dream of mine to achieve a high quality of
life performing and producing music. I would 
want whatever project we pursue to yield this for us.
I do believe that all of these roads could lead to this
outcome to varying degrees. It's on us to decide to hold     one another accountable to achieving this that will determine if we can be successful. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Making Music Together</strong> When we come together and work to make music, the outcome is often incredible. I think that given the opportunity and resources, we are just scratching the surface of our creative potential. We haven't begun to tap into the farthest reaches of our influences or push ourselves far out of our creative comfort zones. In doing the aforementioned things and striving for the highest degree of excitement and joy for the music we create, I think we will unlock many great opportunities. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Resist is still a very appealing project to me for 
a lot of reasons. We've created a full album that we
haven't put much effort into promotion and exposure. 
The style of music; the technicality, the songwriting are 
all unique and really something I think we should be proud of. 
It would be a disservice to not allow that music to be heard. As far as the potential for 'success in metal', I don't think it's fair to pass judgement on an outcome we have yet to pursue or achieve. The world truly is a wide open place and their are many people who achieve great success doing all sorts of unique and interesting things. Resist has the potential to do the same if only we are willing to give it that chance and give it our all.</p>

<a id="user-content-edm--top-40-writing" class="anchor" href="#edm--top-40-writing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>EDM / Top 40 Writing</h2>

<p>Electronica and Pop music are genres I enjoy and I think we could easily create great things in that sphere. I digress however in saying that we could very well incorporate all styles of music into our process and I would argue that we stand a better chance in doing so. We all come from various influences and various styles of songwriting and I think that is what will make us unique as EDM or as Hard Rock songwriters. </p>

<p>We love syncopation, thumping drums emphasis on the back-beat, heavy guitars, soaring vocals, ambience, dark and brooding progressions, metal, hip-hop, dubstep, chillstep.. etc. It's gonna be a part of the music me make regardless but I say we make an intentional effort and in doing so we will find our voice in any genre and maybe even define our own. That's what excites me and that's where our head should be at: EDM, Hard Rock, Pop, Metal or whatever.</p>

<a id="user-content-cover-band" class="anchor" href="#cover-band" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cover Band</h2>

<p>The cover band I think plays an essential role in showing potential fans and the industry at large that we can be relatable as songwriters and in a way is how most if not all bands 'pay their dues' so to speak. It is gonna help us reach fans we wouldn't otherwise and will provide as a gateway to our original tunes. Ultimately that's all I think it provides us.</p>

<p>We could make money in the interim, get in reps performing as band doing it, find cool riffs and cool ideas in learning other peoples music but in the end I think that's all it get's us. I would want to consider what it would take to involve Jonathan and other members if necessary and how frequently we could do so. </p>

<p>Another idea would be to have Resist do covers on a monthly basis, Jonathan providing vocals and additionally have a cover band we could play out regularly with. There are many ways to slice this one. The official Resist covers help us build a following in the same way Jessie did with his videos and serve to introduce people to our sound. </p>
